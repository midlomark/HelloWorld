Learning how to create a GitHub repository and projec

I am attempting to join the "organized" coding world after a long career of
Corporate Real Estate strategy management.  I interested in 
collaborating and learning from anyone who is willing to help
me on my journey towards creating a home automation system.

I'm starting with basic temp, humidity and methane gas sensors
to control bathroom exhaust fans.  I hope to find how to code better
and, thru my mistakes and contributions, help others do the same.
